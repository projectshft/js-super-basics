# JavaScript Basics Learning Project

Welcome to the JavaScript Basics Learning Project! This repository is designed to help you learn JavaScript fundamentals through interactive lessons and challenges. Each lesson focuses on a key JavaScript concept, followed by exercises that you'll complete and test.

## Setting Up the Project

### Prerequisites

-   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system. This will include npm (Node Package Manager), which is used to manage dependencies and run scripts.

### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd js-basics-learn
    ```

### Installing Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Running and Testing Your Solutions

Each lesson comes with a set of challenges that you can test to ensure your solution is correct.

I recommend you run the tests in `watch-mode`

```bash
npm run watch
```

When you complete a challenge. Simply remove this comment at the end of the file:

`// âœ… REMOVE THIS LINE to check your work`

OR

You can manually run tests like this ðŸ‘‡

1. Navigate to the root of your project directory.
2. To run the tests for a specific lesson, use the following command:
    ```bash
    npm test -- [test-file-name]
    ```
    For example, to test your solutions for Lesson 2, run:
    ```bash
    npm test -- __tests__/02_Variables.test.js
    ```
